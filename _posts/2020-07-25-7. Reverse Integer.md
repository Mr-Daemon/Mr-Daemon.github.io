### 7. Reverse Integer

> [source link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

##### Description

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.  

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31^, 2^31^ − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

##### Signature

```c
int reverse(int x);
```

##### Analysis

0. NOTICE THAT, when we deal with specific digit number (in this problem is 32-bits), the overflow is one thing that worth the attention! Always think about if this sloc will cause overflow!! KEEP IN MIND the `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX`.
1. First I get the sign of the input number, and calculate its absolute value and store in `y` . Because of x can be `INT_MIN` (`0x80000000`), so before calculate its absolute value we need to declare `sign` and `y` as `long` to avoid overflow.
2. Then desperate `y` digit by digit (base 10) and store the reverse order vector in `array`. Also set the `multi` be the largest power term. To avoid overflow we declare `multi` as `long`.
3. In order to detect overflow, we declare `r` as `long` and test it with `0x000000007FFFFFFF` and `(long)(0xFFFFFFFF80000000)` to supervise if there occurred overflow.

##### Solution

```c
int reverse(int x)
{
    long sign = (x >> 31u) | 1;
    long y = sign * x;
    long multi = 1;
    unsigned char array[16];
    int cur = 0;
    while (y >= 10)
    {
        array[cur++] = y % 10;
        y /= 10;
        multi *= 10;
    }
    array[cur++] = y % 10;
    long r = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < cur; i++)
    {
        r += array[i] * multi;
        multi /= 10;
    }
    r *= sign;
    if (r > 0x000000007FFFFFFF || r < (long)(0xFFFFFFFF80000000))
        return 0;
    return r;
}
```
