### 9. Palindrome Number

> [source link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

##### Description

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

##### Signature

```c
int isPalindrome(int x);
```

##### Analysis

That problem is tooooo easy and I obtained ac at the first time. Nothing to talk about.

##### Solution

```c
int isPalindrome(int x)
{
    if (x < 0)
        return 0;
    else if (x == 0)
        return 1;
    unsigned char array[10];
    int cur = 0;
    while (x != 0)
    {
        array[cur++] = x % 10;
        x /= 10;
    }
    int low = 0, high = cur - 1;
    while (low < high)
    {
        if (array[low] != array[high])
            return 0;
        ++low;
        --high;
    }
    return 1;
}
```
