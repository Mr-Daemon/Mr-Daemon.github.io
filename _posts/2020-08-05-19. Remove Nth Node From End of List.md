### 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

> [source link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

##### Description

Given a linked list, remove the *n*-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Given *n* will always be valid.

##### Signature

```c
struct ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(struct ListNode* head, int n);
```

##### Analysis

At the beginning I think this problem is quite easy and donâ€™t need any analysis, BUT in this problem, the `head` point to the first element in list! That sucks! And if your input like `[1] 1`, the expect output is `NULL`, quite weird. Use linked list without head node sucks, donnot use that!

##### Solution

```c
struct ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(struct ListNode* head, int n) {
    struct ListNode* prev = head;
    struct ListNode* curr = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    if(!curr){
        prev = head->next;
        free(head);
        return prev;
    }
    while (curr->next) {
        prev = prev->next;
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    struct ListNode* temp = prev->next;
    prev->next = temp->next;
    free(temp);
    return head;
}
```
