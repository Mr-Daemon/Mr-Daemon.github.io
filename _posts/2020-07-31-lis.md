### lis

##### Description

Give a `array` , to find the length of its longest increasing subsequence (lis).

##### Signature

```c
int lis(int* array, int n);
```

##### Analysis

That problem is used to study *dynamic programming*.

0. Let `array` = {a~0~, a~1~, …, a~n~}, and use `f(i)` to represent the lis of {a~0~, a~1~, …, a~i~}. And notice that if there exist such `p` satisfied p<i and array[p]<array[i], the `f(i)` can be `f(p)+1` . So we can easily obtain an equation: $\ f(i)=max_{p<i,array[p]<array[i]}{\{f(p)+1,f(i-1)\}}$. 
1. According to above equation we can instantly get an $\ O(n^{2})$ solution by creating a array which i-th element indicates `f(i)` and doing double loop to search. But now we will do some optimizations to reduce the time complexity to $\ O(nlog n)$.
2. For the $\ O(n^{2})$ solution, we still waste some time on the impossible cases, to avoid this and do further leaf-cut, we can set a array `min_val_list`, which i-th element indicates the min val of *lis* which length is i. So we can do binary search in inner loop when array[i] <= min_val_list[len] \(`len` is current length of lis\), we find the index `j` such that array[i] <= min_val_list[j] and array[i] > min_val_list[j-1], and we update the `min_val_list[j]` if array[i] < min_val_list[low]. It is worth noticing that we always keep the `min_val_list[j]` is the min value in order to make it easy to add later elements and `min_val_list[0:len+1]` is meanless as a entity.

##### Solution

```c
int lis(int* array, int n) {
    int min_val_list[n];
    min_val_list[0] = array[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        min_val_list[i] = 0x7fffffff;
    }
    int len = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (array[i] > min_val_list[len]) {
            min_val_list[++len] = array[i];
        } else {
            int low = 0;
            int high = len;
            while (low < high) {
                int mid = (low + high) / 2;
                if (min_val_list[mid] > array[i]) {
                    high = mid;
                } else if (min_val_list[mid] < array[i]) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            min_val_list[low] = array[i] < min_val_list[low] ? array[i] : min_val_list[low];
        }
    }
    return len + 1;
}
```
